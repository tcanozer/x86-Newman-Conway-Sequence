# x86-Newman-Conway-Sequence
Define a subroutine called CONWAY in FAR type that finds the elements of the array defined by the recursion relation given below. Design the CONWAY subroutine to accept input parameters over the stack and return values over the stack. Design the PRINTINT subroutine, which prints the return value of the CONWAY subroutine to the console in decimal. Write the main routine, the CONWAY subroutine, the PRINTINT subroutine in assembly language, which calls the CONWAY subroutine with an input value of 10.
